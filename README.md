# FBidu's dotfiles

Okay after setting up different computers for my use a lot of times and often surprising myself typing some alias and getting an obvious error, I decided to keep some of my dotfiles on GitHub.
This kind of stuff is highly customized, so you should make your own aliases and so on. If you want to take this repo as a starting point, go for it. But don't blindly clone & use it. 
If you are interested - and I highly recommend you to - keep your dotfiles on a version control, please read [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/)
